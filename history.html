        <h4>Release Notes</h4>

        <p>Please note: I really tried my best but there are thousands upon thousands of different nationalities, ethnicities, tribal groups etc, and i simply cannot do all of them. 
            I am not using an API to randomly pull these names--although maybe i should. i am literally just looking them up on line. Thus, some of these nationalities may be a little stereotypical/generic ex: indian includes names from different ethnic groups such as hindi, gujarati, etc. ex: black is more african american type names.
        Some may seem sterotypical and if you really do take offense to it, please state so in the requests box. however, i mean this is just what helped me. i made this for me lol, so please don't be to mad xoxo</p>
        <p>Also if you have a specific name you want me to add, you can suggest it, but i encourage you to use the random generation option and just input whatever name you would like!!</p>

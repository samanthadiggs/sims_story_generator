# sims_story_generator

This website was mainly created to help me as i indulge in my project of recreating all my townies in Sims 4. You can use this to just get names or stories. 

For my gameplay, I like each townie to have its own story/description, so whichever one i choose to play has some like idk criteria that i have to follow (just to keep the game fun and interesting)

however i cant sit and come up with each one on my own, so i decided to automate it!!

Obviusly since this is randomly generaterated, not every thing will make sense/sound right, so tweak whateber you want. This is mainly so i dont have to come up with everything from scratch!

For example if it says, Sim 1 loves computers. She wants to be a vetrinarian when she grows up. Obviously that doesn't make sense, so you can just change either her love/desire or the career.

In future modifications, I might make adjustments to the code so that this doesn't happen, but for now I wont!
